# Vocabulary Memorization Website

A vocabulary review website developed as a [Codementor.io](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/vocabulary-memorization-website-b0wnnh30k3) project. Developed in Angular with [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home).

# Description

This is a website which allows users to review the vocabulary they learned in foreign languages, similar to language cards. The users can add languages and words to study. The words they add will be randomly presented to them in their native language, and the user should enter the translation in the foreign language.

## Features

- Add multiple languages
- Study words interactively
- Get scores and results instantly

## How to use

To use this website, first sign up by creating a new account. Don't forget to specify your native language! Then, add any language that you want to learn from the list of languages, and start adding words to your list of study words.  
Once you feel like there are enough words, switch to **study mode** to start studying those words. A word in your native language will pop up on your screen. In the field below, type what you think the word means in the foreign language.  
When you finish studying, either after finishing all words or by quitting, you'll see your score (correct / total). Your score will be saved and in your next run, you can compare your score to your previous score.
